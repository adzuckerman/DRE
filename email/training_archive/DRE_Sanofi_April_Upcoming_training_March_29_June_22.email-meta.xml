Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
Sanofi and Doctor Evidence have initiated a year-long engagement in order to provide Sanofi personnel with relevant data to answer timely research questions. Doctor Evidence (DRE) is a technology and research services company that finds, synthesizes and analyzes information from published sources. We will work with you--at no cost--to create deliverables such as Systematic Literature Reviews, Meta-Analyses, Landscape Analyses, Comparative Safety Assessments, Regulatory Responses and more using our dynamic platforms and professional services.  The engagement includes extensive assets across several therapeutic areas (Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Immunology, Multiple Sclerosis, General Medicines).  You are invited to attend Doctor Evidence’s Introductory training so that you can maximize use of the Doctor Evidence services and platforms. Upcoming dates for a Webinar version of the training are offered below.
You can also take a self-paced, online version of the Introductory course. To do so, self-enroll at https://dre.litmos.com/self-signup/. Enter the code “Sanofi” when you create your account on this sign-up page, and you will automatically be enrolled in the course.
Kind Regards,

Nancy Morgan
Director of Education and Training
