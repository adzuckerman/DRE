Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I was looking at this years AMCP attendee list and I was interested to see if you would have some time to meet up with our CEO Bob Batista and our SVP Mika Newton, even over a coffee or lunch. As someone who I know has a great appreciation for EBM, you will enjoy the intro and meeting.

Please let me know if you have interest as I have Banu copied to support.

Thank you again and hope this works,
