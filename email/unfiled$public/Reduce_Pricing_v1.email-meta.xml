    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



As announced at the recent G-I-N 2016 Conference in Philadelphia and in this press release, Doctor Evidence is pleased to offer reduced platform fees to the {!Account.Name}. Annual platform licensing is now $15,000 USD (some restrictions apply), and includes free and unlimited access to all pre-digitized studies (now numbering over 20,000).


GROWTH Research licensing (available at a slightly higher price) will allow {!Account.Name} to offer access to the technologies and digital studies as a member benefit for all of your members.



Please let us know if you would like a revised formal proposal reflecting these special pricing rates, or if you would like to schedule a full demo for you and your team.



This offer is valid for 2017 pricing if contracted by December 31, 2016.


We look forward to hearing from you.
