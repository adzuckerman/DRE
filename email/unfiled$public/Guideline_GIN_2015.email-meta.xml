    <subject>Which Technology Platform Do Global Guideline Societies Trust The Most?</subject>
    <textOnly>Doctor Evidence has been selected by some of the leading guideline Societies, including the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, ASCO, ACCP (CHEST) and others to do the evidence reviews underlying their guidelines.  Reed Elsevier also uses the DRE platform for their evidence system to inform their market facing guidance products, like ClinicalKey.  DRE clients now enjoy using the fully integrated features of the R statistical modules, including the accepted model by NICE and CMS for indirect, network treatment comparisons using Bayesian methods. Please visit our GROWTH site and enjoy the commentaries written by some of the leading global policy advocates from the IOM and EBM community:

This month’s GROWTH Commentary is the final contribution to the 5-part series of commentaries reflecting on the past 4 years since the landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM, now the National Academy of Medicine) reports on Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust and Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews were published.

In previous essays,

Sheldon Greenfield, MD, as Chair of the first of these reports, launched this series by commenting on the state of guidelines and guideline development today.
Mary Nix, MS, PMP, Staff Lead of the AHRQ National Guidelines Clearinghouse (NGC), discussed the NGC inclusion criteria that were revamped as a result of recommendations from the IOM report and how the revised criteria have impacted the submissions of guidelines.
