    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You now have access to DOC Label, Doctor Evidence’s easy-to-use web-based labeling platform.  DOC Label provides pharma professionals with valuable insights via quick and easy review of the entire landscape of US and UK approved labels, and provides content which can be used in the creation of labeling or regulatory documents. DOC Label is a centralized platform for structured and unstructured data contained in US and UK physician labels, as well as patient medication guides and patient information leaflets.

You are invited to a training to learn to use DOC Label to:

Search, browse, and compare labels with simple or complex keywords (enhanced with synonym libraries and natural language processing tools)
Create automatic alerts for new labels, new versions of existing labels, and key search terms of interest
View side-by-side results of multiple labels in an interactive search environment
Access all label versions and related agency communications for each compound
Export results to Word, Excel, or HTML

Please respond to this email with the training session that works best for you; you will receive an Outlook invitation for the date you select. If you are unable to attend any of the listed training sessions, please reach out to me and we can work together to set up a one-on-one session.

 25 July 2018 | 10-11 AM EST | 4-5 PM CET |
 28  August 2018 | 10-11 AM EST | 4-5 PM CET|

I’ve attached to this email a short slide deck outlining how this state of the art technology solution can bring increased efficiency and cost savings to your organization.
I look forward to your participation!

Sincerely,

Ash Srivastava, M.D.
