DOC Data is a powerful environment for structuring data and generating analysis from full-text clinical studies and other epidemiology sources. DOC Data enables finger-tip ready review and analysis of data for direct and indirect analysis.  The methodologies incorporated into the DOC Data platform meet the highest global evidence-based medicine standards and practices.  Data analytics are directly integrated into the R Project for Statistical Computing modules so there is no denigration tied to data portability issues.  The centralization and structuring of clinical data into a single, quality-controlled data hub and networked repository streamlines access and integration into an organization’s best-practices workflows.


DOC Library has over 250,000 screened citations in it for the above topics and DOC Data has over 20 million highly curated data points.
