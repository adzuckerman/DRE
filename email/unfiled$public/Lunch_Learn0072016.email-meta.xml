This is an open session (walk-ins welcome and encouraged!) where we will be providing training and support on 3 of our technology resources that will be of greatest use to AbbVie associates:
DOC Library,
DOC Data,
and DOC Label.
We will also be answering questions related to any existing DRE projects as well as discussing new evidence-related needs and opportunities.
We would love to see you there, so please stop by and bring your research questions!
