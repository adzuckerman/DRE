    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Sanofi has engaged with Doctor Evidence to provide Sanofi personnel with relevant data to answer timely research questions. Doctor Evidence (DRE) is a technology and research services company that finds, synthesizes and analyzes information from published sources. We will work with you--at no cost--to create deliverables such as Systematic Literature Reviews, Meta-Analyses, Landscape Analyses, Comparative Safety Assessments, Regulatory Responses and more using our dynamic platforms and professional services.

We would like to invite you to attend a training relevant to the particular needs of Sanofi Genzyme Emerging Markets. The two-hour training will provide an overview of the DRE platforms and services, potential use cases for your group, and hands-on training on two of our platforms.

To accommodate different time zones, we will be holding the same training at different times. Please email me the session you are interested in at nmorgan@doctorevidence.com, and I will send you a calendar invite with the log-in information. 
August 29, 2017  11 am -1 pm CST
September 13, 2017 4 -6 pm CEST






Sincerely,


Nancy Morgan
