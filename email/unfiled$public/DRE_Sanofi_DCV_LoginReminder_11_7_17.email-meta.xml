Dear {!Contact.Name},

This is a reminder that you have access to the Doctor Evidence DOC Library and DOC Data packages for Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Immunology, Multiple Sclerosis and Established Medicines (including Consumer Health).  A Single-sign on (SSO) system will allow you to use your existing Sanofi credentials to login to the Doctor Evidence Platform by navigating to:  https://sanofi.doctorevidence.com/

You also now have access through this same Single-sign on system to DOC Search, Doctor Evidence&apos;s advanced search tool. Please take a minute to explore the tool, and watch out for training announcements about DOC Search, beginning December of 2017.

To initiate a project with DRE, please complete this brief form: https://reports.doctorevidence.com/pages/Client/ServiceProject.aspx.

Please also find attached the slides from our Introductory Training and a quickguide for DOC Library. Please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out with any training needs. On behalf of the Doctor Evidence Team, we are looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.

Thank You,

Nancy Morgan
