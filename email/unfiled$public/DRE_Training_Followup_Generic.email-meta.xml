    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
Thanks for participating in the Doctor Evidence training today. Attached please find the slide deck from the presentation. Here are some quickguides to help you navigate DOC Search. I also made available some videos demonstrating how to use the DOC Search platform here: https://dre.litmos.com?C=661222.  Your username is your email, but you&apos;ll need to create a password.

You can access the platforms at https://merck.doctorevidence.com.  Please donâ€™t hesitate reach out if you need support in using the system. 

Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact Laura Guild at lguild@doctorevidence.com if you need additional services.

Sincerely,

Nancy Morgan
