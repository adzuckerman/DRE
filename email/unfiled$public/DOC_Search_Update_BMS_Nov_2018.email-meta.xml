DOC Search technology is populated with ASH and ASCO meeting abstracts, enabling analysis of methods, results, and trends to prepare for upcoming meetings:

Meeting Preparation: New meeting abstracts are released in-system on the embargo date. Save searches and immediately receive targeted reference lists to prepare for upcoming meetings
Automated Term Indexing: NLP technology is applied to all meeting abstracts to index the reported patient characteristics, interventions, and outcome measures. Review a summary table of this automated term indexing to identify the top co-occurring concepts in your topic area of interest.
Author Analysis: Identify the top thought leaders presenting in your topic areas of interest and inform strategy and planning for meeting attendance. Review an author&apos;s full list of publications, along with their affiliations, contact information, scientific network, and more.
Lineage: Quickly navigate between associated references with automated linkage to the other data sources in DOC Search. Follow the lineage of a study from the original trial registration, to meeting abstracts, and all the way to primary and secondary manuscript publications, news articles, and drug labels.

ASH DOC Search and ASCO DOC Search are separate, supplementary add-on content options to the DOC Search base subscription.
