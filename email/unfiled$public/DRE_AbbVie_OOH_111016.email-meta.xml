Based on the audience, we will be sharing examples of the use cases below with
our DOC Data platform.

Immunology HEOR (ICER Psoriasis Report)
Doctor Evidence worked with HEOR Immunology team to perform a comprehensive systematic literature search and analytics to replicate ICER’s search strategy and analytical framework. AbbVie gained insights into data used in ICER’s report and analysis to ensure fair and balanced evidence review.  The team is now able to provide timely and evidence supported input on methodology, inclusion/exclusion, analysis, findings, and recommendations.
