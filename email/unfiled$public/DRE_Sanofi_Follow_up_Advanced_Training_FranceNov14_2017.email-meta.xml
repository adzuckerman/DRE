Thanks for participating in the Doctor Evidence Advanced training. Here is the slide-deck from this week’s presentations. 

You also have access to how-to videos and quick-guides which describe the steps necessary to navigate the DOC Data platform. To view this content, please navigate to https://dre.litmos.com?C=483766 and create an account if you do not already have one. (Your email is your user name, but you will need to create a password.) 

Please take a moment to browse the DRE publications, which will give you an idea of the breadth of our work and the capabilities of our services: http://drevidence.com/publications/.
