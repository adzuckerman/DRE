Understand what types of research these data support
Perform sophisticated meta-analyses, sensitivity and sub-group analyses with ease
Learn how to incorporate output from analyses into documents, evidence tables and other deliverables.

Look forward to seeing you soon,

This is an open session (walk-ins welcome and encouraged!) where we will be providing training and support on 3 of our technology resources that will be of greatest use to AbbVie associates:
DOC Library,

We will also be answering questions related to any existing DRE projects as well as discussing new evidence-related needs and opportunities.
We would love to see you there, so please stop by and bring your research questions!
