Doctor Evidence (DRE) is a specialty evidence-based medicine software platform and services company that is engaged with AbbVie to provide the most relevant medical evidence and related analytics to inform AbbVieâ€™s clinical and care decisions in Immunology, HCV, and Endometriosis.
We will be sharing examples of the use cases below with our DOC Data platform.

Use Case Immunology Team:
Long-term comparative efficacy across different treatment options in RA was illustrated via network meta-analysis using the DOC Data platform

Use Case HCV Team:
Real world effectiveness and safety of HCV therapies was demonstrated by digitizing all available observational data on 2D and 3D in DOC Data platform and performing a series of meta-analyses to show overall effect across different patient populations.

Use Case Immunology team:
Benefit-risk assessment of established Psoriasis therapies is being performed using the DOC Data platform and network meta-analysis tool, to aid in benefit-risk assessment for pipeline molecules.

Looking forward to seeing you!
