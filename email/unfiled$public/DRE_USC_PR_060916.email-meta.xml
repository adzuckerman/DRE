Nationâ€™s First Digital Health Fellowship Created at
USC Center for Body Computing

SANTA MONICA, Calif., June 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Doctor Evidence, a leading evidence-based medicine company, announced today it will provide a grant to the University of Southern California (USC) Center for Body Computing (CBC) for the nation&apos;s first   Digital Health Fellowship in the U.S.  The 1-year Fellowship is a first of its kind digital health research and clinical training program developed at the CBC. Dr. Andrew Keibel, who is a recent graduate of the Keck Medicine of USC&apos;s Internal Medicine Residency Program, was chosen as the first Fellow. He will work on the CBC&apos;s innovative solutions for improving doctor/patient shared decision-making and collaboration through connected care health applications using data provided by Doctor Evidence (DRE).

&quot;For the last 12 years, we&apos;ve led the country&apos;s top university-based research and strategic development partnerships for digital health, wearable tech and medical apps, so creating a Fellowship specifically for digital health was a natural next step,&quot; said Leslie Saxon, MD, founder and executive director of the USC CBC and the Fellowship supervisor. &quot;We&apos;re grateful to the generous support provided by Doctor Evidence to make this happen.&quot;
