Dear {!Contact.Name},
Doctor Evidence is an evidence based medicine company that brings innovative software solutions to the pharmaceutical industry. We provide analytical capabilities necessary to remain competitive within the current dynamic economic and regulatory environment.

DOC Label is a centralized solution for structured and unstructured data contained in US and UK physician labels, as well as patient medication guides and patient information leaflets (PIL).

Some of the key features of the DOC Label Solution are:

Search, browse, and compare labels with simple or complex keywords (now enhanced with synonym libraries and natural language processing tools)
Automatic alerts - new labels, new versions of existing labels, and key search terms of interest
Side-by-side results of multiple labels in an interactive search environment
Access all label versions and related agency communications for each compound
Export results to Word, Excel, or HTML

DOC Label enables Medical Affairs departments to stay privy to competitors’ labeling changes to provide support for approved products. I’ve attached to this email an example of a side-by-side comparison of the adverse reactions sections for head and neck cancer therapeutics generated by our state of the art technology solution.

I would appreciate the opportunity to share the benefits of DOC Label with you and your leadership team. I’d like to schedule 30 minutes with you, or to meet with you and your team during your next staff meeting to demonstrate and explain the benefits this tool will bring to your team and cross-functional partners through a number of use cases we’ve developed based on direct input from our current enterprise subscribers.

I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you soon and thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
