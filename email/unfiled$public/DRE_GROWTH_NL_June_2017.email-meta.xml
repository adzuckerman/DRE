July Commentary: 2017 GROWTH Commentary Series:
US Agency for International Development (USAID) By Kelly Saldana, MPIA, MPH

Doctor Evidence has partnered with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to increase the accuracy and reliability of healthcare utilization estimates and economic forecasts. The powerful technologies of Doctor Evidence, combined with the comprehensive Global Burden of Disease epidemiological data of IHME, will be integrated into real-world evidence data hubs to support clinical guidelines, health technology assessments, and comparative effectiveness analyses. Visionaries like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will utilize these combined resources and knowledge to forecast both healthcare needs and policies or interventions that demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating those burdens. The result will be improved healthcare strategy from start to finish, guided by efficient and targeted analyses and conclusions.</textOnly>
