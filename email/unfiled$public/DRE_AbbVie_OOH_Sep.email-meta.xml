Use Case HCV – Incidence and Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (EMA PRAC Regulatory Response)

Doctor Evidence worked with the AbbVie Safety/Epi team to address an urgent regulatory request by PRAC (Article 20, EMA) to provide a comprehensive summary of data on incidence and recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). DAA and interferon studies identified as a results of the literature review were extracted into a relational database and summarized to inform AbbVie’s regulatory response strategy.

Doctor Evidence (DRE) is a specialty evidence-based medicine software platform and services company that is engaged with AbbVie to provide the most relevant medical evidence and related analytics to inform AbbVie’s clinical and care decisions in Immunology, HCV, and Endometriosis.
Based on the audience, we will be sharing examples of the use cases below with
our DOC Data platform.

Looking forward to seeing you!
