Immunology HEOR (Prevalence of EAMs in SpA)
Doctor Evidence worked with AbbVie Immunology HEOR team to address a key differentiation strategy for Humira in SpA. A high quality comprehensive review of evidence library and evidence tables were delivered within a very tight timeline to create awareness and to compare and contrast the EAM prevalence worldwide. A Meta-Analysis, abstract and publication will be soon to follow (EULAR 2017)

Looking forward to seeing you!
