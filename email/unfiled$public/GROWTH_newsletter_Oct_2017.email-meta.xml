2017 GROWTH COMMENTARY SERIES: GLOBAL HEALTH (PART 5)  Understanding Global Health Statistics through Visual Presentations With Anna Rosling-Rönnlund
Gapminder Co-Founder and Vice President

For this month’s commentary, GROWTH interviewed Anna Rosling-Rönnlund, Vice President and Head of Creativity at Gapminder, the organization that has developed amazing video representations of global socioeconomic and health data in fascinating displays. The Gapminder team considers their organization to be a “fact tank” not a “think tank,” as they produce resources based on reliable data to make the world more understandable and to correct misconceptions about global development.

Global Health Part 6: Global Health Initiative Resolve to Save Lives
By Tom Frieden, MD, MPH
President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives
Former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Congratulations to the Global Burden of Disease collaborator network on the release of the 2016 study and 20 years of collaborations and innovations!
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data collection, analyses, and dissemination involves nearly 2,500 collaborators from across more than 130 countries and territories. The massive effort is masterfully coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, in Seattle, WA (USA). Doctor Evidence has many staff who are participants in this network.
The GBD marked its 20th anniversary late last month with a 3-day series of plenary and panel sessions on the history of the GBD, current challenges, and future plans. Many collaborators and dignitaries, including Bill Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Dr. Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank, congratulated the GBD network and offered insights into how significantly this data has impacted health and healthcare on local and global scales. If you were unable to attend, you can view the archived presentations.
The GBD study has just published its latest global estimates (based on 2016 data) for the state of the world’s health in The Lancet issue published on September 14, 2017. The GBD is the only annual, comprehensive, peer-reviewed assessment of global trends in health, providing global and national estimates on more than 330 diseases, causes of death, and injuries in 195 countries and territories worldwide.

Doctor Evidence is a proud partner and collaborator with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the Global Burden of Disease. Contact us for more information. From left to right Melanie Golob, Edan Shalev, Todd Feinman, Michael del Aguila, Bob Battista.

ASCO DOC Search
Perform a comprehensive search within and across American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting abstracts. Multi-year research will be possible, as meeting abstracts for the past 20 years and all future years will eventually be included in the repository. This technology will also allow researchers to follow the evolution of research from abstracts to published papers, as well as any post-hoc or follow-up studies that use the same study populations. Tracing these linkages helps avoid double counting patients while facilitating complex analyses.
