Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
I wanted to follow-up and see if you are interested in meeting with Doctor Evidence at the 22nd international ISPOR event coming up May 22nd – 24th in Boston.

The Doctor Evidence team will be conducting demonstrations of our evidence-based products and services in a meeting room at the Sheraton Boston hotel adjacent to the Convention Center.
Let me know if you are interested in meeting on Monday, May 22nd, Tuesday, May 23rd, or Wednesday, May 24th?

Please click here if you are interested in scheduling time to meet.
