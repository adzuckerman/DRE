Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
We are pleased to invite you to the Doctor Evidence Open office hours: Wednesday,  August 10th for two sessions:

Room: US-LC-ABV1-2SW-205-03 Doctor Evidence (DRE) is a specialty evidence-based medicine software platform and services company that is engaged with AbbVie to provide the most relevant medical evidence and related analytics to inform AbbVie’s clinical and care decisions in Immunology, HCV, and Endometriosis.
Based on the audience, we will be sharing examples of the use cases below with
our DOC Data platform.

Use Case Immunology team:
Benefit-risk assessment of established Psoriasis therapies is being performed using the DOC Data platform and network meta-analysis tool, to aid in benefit-risk assessment for pipeline molecules.

Use Case HCV Team:
Real world effectiveness and safety of HCV therapies was demonstrated by digitizing all available observational data on 2D and 3D in DOC Data platform and performing a series of meta-analyses to show overall effect across different patient populations.

Abstract accepted by EASL/AASLD Conf in September

Oncology Use Case (CLL)
Incidence rates of Richter’s transformation across interventional studies of high-risk CLL patients were summarized to inform the strategy for PRAC Regulatory response.

Looking forward to seeing you!
